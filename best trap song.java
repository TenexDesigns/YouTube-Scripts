**[Intro]**

Yo, Kelvin Hart, let's have some fun  
Time to roast you under the sun

---

**[Verse 1]**

Kelvin Hart, you're short as hell  
Should be riding ponies, not horses, what the smell?  
The Rock carries you in every flick  
Literally and metaphorically, it's a quick fix

Old head, need a rest, stop with the kids  
Kai Cenat too young, you belong with Epstein bids  
No Netflix specials, just shows with no views  
No ticket sales, just a snooze cruise

---

**[Chorus]**

Divorced in marriage, what's that about?  
Can't keep a woman, money can't buy a peaceful clout  
Talentless, relying on The Rock's hold  
To keep your career from being cold

---

**[Verse 2]**

Nobody's giving an ear to your recycled shit  
Boo and let Dave Chappelle, real comedy hit  
Never back home to Philly, pride's misplaced  
Prodigal son ain't coming back, it's a disgrace

Lavish life, wasting money like it grows on trees  
Buy yourself some height before the money flees  
Back to Philadelphia, where it all began  
But you ain't welcome now, just a failed plan

---

**[Chorus]**

Divorced in marriage, what's that about?  
Can't keep a woman, money can't buy a peaceful clout  
Talentless, relying on The Rock's hold  
To keep your career from being cold

---

**[Outro]**

Kelvin Hart, short ride, no jokes, just pride  
But your career's fading, nowhere to hide  
Stick to riding ponies, that's your call  
Before you're back to Philly, standing tall
