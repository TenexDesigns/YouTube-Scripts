(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night, under the moon's soft glow,
I watch you walk away, my heart sinking low.
Amy, my dear, with eyes like stars that shine,
You're leaving me behind, but you'll forever be mine.

(Chorus)
Oh Amy, my love, why must you go?
Leaving me here, drowning in woe.
I'll hold onto memories, cherish them dear,
But without you, my love, my world's unclear.

(Verse 2)
Your laughter, your smile, like sunlight in the rain,
I'll miss your gentle touch, your warmth in every grain.
But I'm just a fool, too afraid to confess,
That you're the one I love, the one I'll always bless.

(Chorus)
Oh Amy, my love, why must you go?
Leaving me here, drowning in woe.
I'll hold onto memories, cherish them dear,
But without you, my love, my world's unclear.

(Bridge)
As you board that plane, my heart breaks in two,
Knowing I'll wake up each morning without you.
But if ever you find, in your heart's secret fold,
A love like mine, waiting, never growing old.

(Chorus)
Oh Amy, my love, why must you go?
Leaving me here, drowning in woe.
I'll hold onto memories, cherish them dear,
But without you, my love, my world's unclear.

(Outro)
So farewell, my love, may your journey be bright,
I'll be here waiting, under the stars of night.
For even though you're far, and our paths may roam,
My love for you, Amy, will always find its home.
