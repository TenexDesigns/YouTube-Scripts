On YouTube, a "channel" refers to a user's personal or brand account where they upload and manage their videos. Each channel is distinct and typically linked to a unique email address, but there are ways to manage multiple channels under a single email account. Here's how it works:

### Brand Accounts
1. **Single Email, Multiple Channels:**
   - **Brand Accounts:** You can create multiple YouTube channels under a single Google Account using Brand Accounts. A Brand Account is an account that is specifically for your brand and is different from your personal Google Account.
   - To set up multiple channels under one email:
     1. Sign in to YouTube with your Google Account.
     2. Go to your channel list (https://www.youtube.com/channel_switcher).
     3. Click "Create a new channel."
     4. Follow the instructions to name your new channel and verify your account.
     5. You can repeat this process to create multiple channels, all managed under the same email address.

2. **Switching Between Channels:**
   - Once you have multiple channels, you can switch between them by clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner of YouTube, then selecting "Switch account." You will see a list of all your channels and can select the one you want to manage.

### YouTube Studio
- **Managing Channels:** YouTube Studio allows you to manage your different channels. Each channel will have its own set of analytics, video uploads, and settings, but you can switch between them easily.

### Benefits of Using Brand Accounts
- **Separate Content:** Each Brand Account allows you to keep content separate, which is useful if you have different types of content or target audiences.
- **Collaborators:** You can add managers to each Brand Account, allowing multiple people to manage the same channel without sharing your Google Account password.

### Summary
- You can create and manage multiple YouTube channels under one email address by using Brand Accounts.
- Each channel is independent, allowing for distinct branding, content, and management.
- Switching between channels is straightforward and can be done directly within YouTube.

This setup is particularly useful for individuals or organizations that need to manage multiple content streams or brands without the hassle of logging in and out of different accounts.
